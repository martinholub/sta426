## Introductory lecture on R in sta426 - Homework
Sample 100 points from lognormal distribution:

```{r sample}
x <- rlnorm(n = 100, meanlog = 1, sdlog = .25)
```

Create histogram of the sampled values:

```{r histogram, echo=TRUE}
hist(x, breaks = 20)
```

Create histogram of the logarithm of sampled values.

``` {r loghistogram}
hist(log(x), breaks =20)
```

Calculate mean and standard deviation of the drawn sample:

```{r moments of distribution}
mu <- mean(x)
sd2 <- var(x)
```
Mean of the sample is mu = `r mu` and variance is var =`r sd2`.
